**Repository Highlights**
Here are some key projects you'll find in this repository:

Interactive Census Data Retrieval, Database Storage, and Visualization (Python, AWS RDS): As my first major Python project, I wanted to explore a topic of interest: population data!  This Python script provides a UI that allows the user to retrieve data from the Census API, store it in an AWS Postgres database, and read or visualize the results.  This was a great first foray into creating a cloud-hosted database, retrieving API data, and storing and visualizing the results in a single script.
